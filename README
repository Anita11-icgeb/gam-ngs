Requirements:

- cmake
- zlib
- boost libraries (at least version 1.44)
- google-sparse-hash

How to build the application:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

Usage:

$ ./gam-ngs blocks <BAM Master CoordinateSorted> <BAM Master NameSorted> <BAM Slave CoordinateSorted> <BAM Slave NameSorted> <Min Block Size> <Min Pairing Evidence> <Master.fasta> <Slave.fasta> <Number of Threads>

Explanation of the arguments:
- <Min Block Size>: number of reads supporting a block (lower values imply longer computation time)
- <Min Pairing Evidence>: this can be set to 1 (higher values imply that some blocks are discarded)

It will output the following files: 
- blocks.txt: description of the similar regions in the assemblies
- pctgs.fasta: fasta file of the output assembly
- pctgs-descriptors.txt: description on how the contigs in pctgs.fasta are built
